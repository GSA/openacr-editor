    notes: "Drupal doesn't make a strong distinction between the front-end & back-end accessibility. Many administration interfaces can be exposed to users in a more interactive site. Generally this report focuses the Conformance Level / Remarks and Explainations so that Web comments are about elements that are typically public, while Authoring Tool is typically for authors and administrators. The goal of the authoring interface is to support ATAG 2.0 AA (Part A and B). The Drupal community strives to beek up with the latest WCAG recommendation."

            adherence:
              level: "supports"
              notes: Drupal 8 requires alt text for images by default.

            adherence:
              level: "supports"
              notes: Some non-textual content in the documentation does not provide a textual alternative.

          - name: "authoring-tool"
            adherence:
              level: "supports"
              notes: The back end of Drupal Core was built to be  WCAG 2.0 AA compliant and non-text content in the administration interface has a textual equivalent. Audio and video can be added to the media library, but Core does not provide tools to manage transcripts and captions/subtitles for local video and audio - Drupal issue 3002770.
      - num: "1.2.1"
        components:
          - name: "web"
            adherence:
              level: "supports"
              notes: Authors can satisfy 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) by using text on the same page.
          - name: "electronic-docs"
            adherence:
              level: "supports"
              notes: This is not explicitly defined in the documentation.
          - name: "software"
            adherence:
              level: "not-applicable"
          - name: "authoring-tool"
            adherence:
              level: "supports"
              notes: There is no additional support for authors within the authoring interface to explain how this can be done.
      - num: "1.2.2"
        components:
          - name: "web"
            adherence:
              level: "does-not-support"
              notes: The file module in Core lets authors upload audio and video content, and output <audio> and <video> elements and does not support captions.
          - name: "electronic-docs"
            adherence:
              level: not-applicable
          - name: "software"
            adherence:
              level: not-applicable
          - name: "authoring-tool"
            adherence:
              level: "does-not-support"
              notes: Drupal does not support, let alone require users to include captions. Hard coding open captions is presently the only way to satisfy this in Core.
      - num: "1.2.3"
        components:
          - name: "web"
            adherence:

              notes: Audio files can be uploaded, but there is no way to associate captions in Core.
          - name: "electronic-docs"
            adherence:
              level: "does-not-support"
              notes: There is no documentation on how to properly convey pre-recorded audio descriptions.

              level: "does-not-support"
              notes: There is no audio in the authoring interface of Drupal Core, but there is no support for authors to upload accessible audio files.

        components:
          - name: "web"
            adherence:
              level: "partially-supports"
              notes: Information is structured into logical relationships. Navigational lists are well used to group information. Forms have a visual and semantic representation for required fields. Message windows have ARIA role defined incorrectly as role=contentinfo which impacts content relationships - Drupal issue 2942404. aria-live announcement is not contained in a landmark - Drupal issue 3098857.

It is worth noting that Drupal's admin is powerful and complex, and there are other accessibility reports in the issue queue.
