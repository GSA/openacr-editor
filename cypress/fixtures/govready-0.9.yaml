notes: >
  All user interfaces for the GovReady software are done through the web interface, so the focus is on the WCAG 2.0 Report.  Chapter 5  has been deleted as it is redundant.  GovReady is built on the Django framework and some of the accessibility issues have been inherited from this framework. GovReady is an open source tool with an open issue queue.
  Accessibility issues identified here will be documented as accessibility issues within existing issue queues. Any workarounds will be available within the issue queue until such time as the problem is resolved. The Authoring Tools components, 504, have not been reviewed in this assessment.
  Content is generally saved in a machine readable format that allows for it to be processed in many ways. All GovReady documentation is available through the web interface, so the focus is on the WCAG 2.0 Report.  Chapter 6 has been deleted as it is redundant. The documentation is being served through Read the Docs and with their default theme. Some accessibility issues have been inherited from this framework.
evaluation_methods_used: >
  Testing was done through a combination of manual and automated testing. We leveraged automated tools WebAim's WAVE Toolbar and Microsoft's Accessibility Insights. Accessibility Insights leverages Deque's open source Axe accessibility engine. Manual testing was done using keyboard interactions and Apple's VoiceOver. Chrome v84 was used as the browser for all tests. Unique patterns were identified and tested to see where barriers might exist. Extensive testing of the site's functionality has been done based on this.

Gradients are used to provide a nice visual effect, but often provide some issues with contrast. Review pages also have elements without sufficient contrast. The Django administration pages have many contrast errors.
